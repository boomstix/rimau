					The crew don&rsquo;t know the details of the final raid, nor that the Rimau mission is backed by extensive planning: a 79-page document with maps, moon charts, notes on the whereabouts of enemy submarines, local fishing vessels and &lsquo;uninhabited&rsquo; islands. And, the men haven&rsquo;t a clue about the ultimate target: a raid on Japanese shipping in the heavily patrolled waters of <strong>Singapore Harbour</strong>.

					According to the plan, before the crew reach the &lsquo;unknown&rsquo; target, they&rsquo;ll first need to capture a local fishing boat; use the native boat to sail under cover and in darkness and then drive the Sleeping Beauties an enormous distance to Singapore Harbour. And if all that works, the men will attach limpet mines and detonators to the hulls of Japanese ships.

					A local police boat comes to investigate; the crew panic and mistake the unarmed police boat for enemy patrol. They shout, &lsquo;Patroller! Patroller!&rsquo; then open fire within view of the settlement on Kasu. The patrol boat sinks and most of its crew are killed.

					<h3>5 days later &mdash; 21 November</h3>
					<h4>&ldquo;None of the Rimau men were waiting&hellip;&rdquo;</h4>

					<p>
					Account drawn from Walter Chapman's report.
					</p>
					<p>
					The <strong>Tantalus</strong> submarine finally arrives at <strong>Merapas</strong> and, after midnight Major Walter Chapman and Corporal Ron Croton paddle through the cloudless night. But the weather turns foul. Heavy surf breaks on the rocky shore of the northern beaches, which forces a long journey around the island. It&rsquo;s 0200 hours before they land and hide their boat in the foreshore scrub.
					</p>
					<p>
					The men climb the hill to the &lsquo;Hammock Tree&rsquo; &mdash;  a tree used to signal boats offshore &mdash; and, in the dark, four and half hours after leaving the submarine, they&rsquo;re glad the Japanese aren&rsquo;t waiting for them. Tired from long weeks cooped up in the sub, the men rest until first light.
					</p>
					<p>
					A search finds nothing to prove the crew are still on the island So Chapman and Croton head down the hill, and then spot a camp in disarray: ration tins strewn on the ground, some filled with uneaten food and fires recently kicked out. Now it&rsquo;s clear that the Rimau men Chapman watched sail off on the Mustika have returned to the island: there&rsquo;s a heavy iron cooking bowl from the boat among the debris.
					</p>
					<p>
					But something is wrong: hidden in the undergrowth is a small rake used to sweep over footprints in the sand, a tool cherished by its owner, Davidson. Why would he leave it behind? There&rsquo;s also a bunch of bananas Chapman figures must have been cut at least two weeks ago: Why leave them behind and why leave the camp in a mess, which would be conspicuous signs for the enemy? There seemed only one conclusion &mdash; battle and death  &mdash; and yet there is no clear evidence of a skirmish.
					</p>
					<p>
					The next night, the &ldquo;pick-up&rdquo; crew paddle back to Tantalus and Chapman reports the bad news. The men won&rsquo;t make the rendezvous (rescue), and &ldquo;it was agreed that no further purpose would be served by returning next night&rdquo;.

					The ten surviving men  &mdash;  those not killed in skirmishes on the islands or killed or drowned during escapes  &mdash;  are captured and taken by the Japanese to Outram Road Gaol where they are held for trial &lsquo;for espionage&rsquo;. The gaol is filthy, overcrowded, and infested with vermin and disease. Fellow prisoners show the signs of malnutrition and physical degradation. Those who transgress an unwritten code of rules are beaten by guards.
					</p>
					<p>
					The survivors suffer the same, stink the same and come to look the same: emaciated with long beards and knotted hair.

					In the final weeks Roma imagines her husband  &mdash;  though terrified and hurting  &mdash; &ldquo;was thinking of me longingly and devastated that he was leaving me&rdquo;. Years later she will read his last letter, written in blue crayon on borrowed paper, dated 28 September 1944:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
					&ldquo;It is a glorious feeling to have of a waiting wife at the end of the journey. This time I&rsquo;m going to knock everyone over in my having to get to you, darling and I&rsquo;m going to swing you around in my arms until you are quite giddy.&rdquo;

					<dl>
					<dt><span>Question 1: </span>Is there any point that you wish to object among the charges that were read for you just now?</dt>
					<dd><span>Answer: </span>No, there is none. They are quite correct.</dd>
					<dt><span>Question 2: </span>Is there anything that you should like to differ from all the statements that Major Ingleton had made just now? Or any opinion?</dt>
					<dd><span>Answer: </span>None, except that I saw once Lieut-Col. Lyon wearing his badge of rank on the junk, but where it was I have forgotten.</dd>
					<dt><span>Question 3: </span>Did you also not use beret cap or badge of rank after off Merapas Island?</dt>
					<dd><span>Answer: </span>I did not use it since we left Pejantang Island.</dd>
					<dt><span>Question 4: </span>We are given to understand that you were wearing sarong on the junk? Is it correct.</dt>
					<dd><span>Answer: </span>It is quite correct.</dd>
					<dt><span>Question 5: </span>Did you bring over that sarong from Australia?</dt>
					<dd><span>Answer: </span>I used the one which I found on the junk and so I do not know where it came from. I am inclined to consider that it was the one used by the Malayan crew of the junk.</dd>
					<dt><span>Question 6: </span>Did you also shoot at the time when your party attacked the police boat near Kasu Island?</dt>
					<dd><span>Answer: </span>Yes, I did. I thought it was a navy patrol ship and I shot it.</dd>
					<dt><span>Question 7: </span>How many times did you fight against the Japanese force after that?</dt>
					<dd><span>Answer: </span>Once on the Merapas Island and once on the other island. I am not sure if I killed any of the Japanese troops.</dd>

					No mercy is &lsquo;permitted&rsquo;, in part because the Japanese interpret the mission&rsquo;s &lsquo;crimes&rsquo; in strict accordance to a particular martial code of heroism. The court likens the Rimau men to Japanese who died in the failed 1942 Japanese submarine raid on Sydney harbour:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
					&ldquo;We do not hesitate to call them the real heroes of forlorn hope&rdquo;
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						&ldquo;The last moment of a hero must be glorious. It must be historic and it must be dramatic. Heroes have more regard for their reputation than anything else. This is the feeling of the Japanese people&rsquo;

					It&rsquo;s the morning of July 7, and the men are taken to the execution site. Japanese sources say that as the men meet their fate, they are in &lsquo;good spirits and composure&rsquo;. But records of exhumation show that the burials were neither &lsquo;glorious&rsquo; nor &lsquo;honourable&rsquo;.

					The Rimau men are buried in three graves, each grave four-foot deep. Five are blindfolded and one is &lsquo;partially&rsquo; decapitated. No identification is found with the bodies, and none wear shoes. The site of burial is &lsquo;thick scrub on the shoulder of a hill&rsquo; and marked by two brown, wooden crosses.
